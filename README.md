# Transparent Democracy - Frontend

## Technical requirements
- NodeJS v22.0.0
- NPM v10.5.1

Installing NodeJS will automatically install the compatible NPM version.

Tip: use [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily install NodeJS and switch between different NodeJS versions.
If you have Homebrew installed, run `brew install nvm`.

## Install dependencies

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
